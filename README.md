# UG Residential Application
_Go through these steps to successfully run the `student resedential application`_
1.  **Create** a `.env` file in the root folder and copy the content of the `.env.sample` file.
_Note: I use a mongodb service that is rendered by mlab_
2.  **Next**, run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to start server.
