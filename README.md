_Go through these steps to successfully run the `student resedential application server`_
1.  **Create** a `.env` file in the root folder and copy the content of the `.env.sample` file.

3. Clone `https://github.com/Bendomey/CSCD-class-project-web.git` repository for the user interface and open login page
